## Project 
In this project we were tasked with making the proogram wokr and writing code for the password generatoor to run and randomly make a password with the specified characters.
## Design
I was given basic starter code like the HTML and CSS files and just had to input code in the JavaScript file. I used the methods we learned in class and some outside of class through the help of MDN, and Geeks4Geeks. I mostly used 'var' because it felt easy to use for me, alos used a few 'if' statemnts, 'function', 'for-return', and 'if-else' statements to generate a random password.
## Closing 
This code will run smoothly, and will give random passwords through the browser.
## User Error
I had to use a lot 'var' variables to set the characteristics of the specified fields and it did make the code longer and hard to read.
